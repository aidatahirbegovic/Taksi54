Taxi booking app

My friend and I built this application for taxies as our BSc project. It was built for Sakarya, city in Turkey where we have studied for
5 years, but it can be used everywhere. 

Customer
Customers write a location where they want to go and they can see all taxies that are near them. By clicking on the driver they can see
drivers photo,phone number, rating and model of the car that he is driving. If they want to call that driver they can click on the button
for calling the driver and after that they will see exactly how far the taxi is if the driver accepts the call, if he refuses to come the
message will pop up. When the ride is done the page for rating the driver will open.

Driver
When drivers receive the call from a customer they can see a picture, name and surname, destionation and phone number of customers. Driver
can refuse or accept the call. If he accepts the route to pick up a customer will be drawn. After he picks up the customer the route to the 
destionation will be drawn.

Both driver and customer need to sign up to use the app.

We built this application in Java (Android Studio), using Firebase (Google Maps API, Places API, Directions API and etc), NodeJS, AngularJS.
